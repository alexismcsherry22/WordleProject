# Project: Wordle

## MVP
-	Recreate a simplified version of the game Wordle to be played in a Java console application
-	The game should be able to randomly select a 5-letter-word from the provided word list
-	The user will be able to enter a guess word that is also 5 characters long
-	For each letter, the application will tell the user if that letter is correct, right letter in the wrong position, or wrong letter
-	After the user guesses 6 times incorrectly, the game is over and the user loses
-	If the user guesses the word correctly, the game is over and the user wins
-	In addition you must implement one fo the following extensions, or an extension of your own design as approved by a Coach

## Extensions
-	Read the word list directly from the file when the application starts
-	Create a history file that keeps track of user-wins/losses and how many letters they guessed it in
-	When the game finishes and the secret word is shown , also display the dictionary definition for that word: Hint: use a free api (https://dictionaryapi.dev/)
-	Generate an output of the word/guesses and copy it to the users clipboard so they can share it on socials | bonus: use emojis
